# Creating Global Card

This guide demonstrates how to create a **Global Virgil Card**. The main feature of Global Virgil Cards is that these Cards contain an identity, which must be confirmed by a user/device. For these cases, Virgil Security has a **Virgil Identity Service** responsible for user identities **validation**. Validating a user occurs after another service â€“ **Virgil RA Service**  authorizes the creation of Global Virgil Cards.

After a Global Virgil Card was created, it's published at the Virgil Card Service, where an owner can find their Cards at any time.

**Warning**: You can not change a Global Virgil Card's content after its publishing.

Each Virgil Card contains a permanent digital signature that provides data integrity for the Virgil Card over its life cycle.

### Let's start to create a Global Virgil Card

Before you begin to create a Global Virgil Card, set up your project environment with the [getting started](/docs/guides/configuration/client-configuration.md) guide.

The Global Virgil Card creation procedure is shown in the figure below.

To create a Global Virgil Card:

1. Developers need to initialize the **Virgil SDK**

```go
api, err := virgilapi.New("")
```

2. Once the SDK is ready we can proceed to the next step:


- Generate and save the **Virgil Key** (it's also necessary to enter the Virgil Key name and password).
- Create a Global Virgil Card using their recently generated Virgil Key (they will need to enter some identifying information).


```go
// generate a Virgil Key
aliceKey, err := api.Keys.Generate()

// save the Virgil Key into storage
err = aliceKey.Save("[KEY_NAME]", "[KEY_PASSWORD]")

// create a Global Virgil Card
aliceCard, err := api.Cards.CreateGlobal("alice@virgilsecurity.com", aliceKey)
```

The Virgil Key will be saved into default device storage. Developers can also change the Virgil Key storage directory as needed, during Virgil SDK initialization.

**Warning**: Virgil doesn't keep a copy of your Virgil Key. If you lose a Virgil Key, there is no way to recover it.

3. Now, developers can initiate an identity verification process.
4. A User has to confirm a Virgil Card's identity using a **confirmation code** received by email.
5. Finally, developers must publish the User's Global Virgil Card on Virgil Services.

```go
// initiate identity verification process
attempt, err := aliceCard.VerifyIdentity()

// confirm an identity and grab the validation token
token, err := attempt.Confirm("[CONFIRMATION_CODE]")

// publish the Virgil Card
publishedCard, err :=  api.Cards.PublishGlobal(aliceCard, token)
```
